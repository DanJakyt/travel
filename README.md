# Travel✈️🧳

The journey is the movement of a certain entity, which people, animals or objects make from a starting point to another distant one. Traveling can be distinguished by the means used for mobility: public or private means of transport, or even on foot. The journey can be understood not only in a physical sense, in a space-time context, but also in a metaphorical sense as an expression of abandonment, inner research, desire.
